Blubbins
I come to this site and open tabs and tabs of data all the time. I learn so much, and if I need more information or some information is suspect, Wikipedia even provides sources. Wikipedia makes me the best Blubbins I can be.

I hate this site

All my students use this site for their research and I get repetitive papers that don't use real research. I keep telling them to use articles from a real literary journal in their papers, but they don't. As a result, they keep getting zeroes on all their assignments and complaining about it. It's all wikipedia's fault.

It has information when I need it, and it's usually pretty accurate. I don't spend that much time on the site, but I've edited it on occasion. I've also lost several dollarydoos on bets settled by wikipedia, but that's not really the sites problem.
