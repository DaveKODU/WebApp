I, Piggy Banks, am mortified at the significance of this financial aid application. To go so far as to offer money services to those in need, through such a convenient means, undermines free market capitalism, which is terrible. After all, free market capitalism benefited my esteemed ancestor Money Banks and allowed all of his descendants to use his finances to thrive without struggle. Why don't POOR people just inherit, like I did?

The program allows me to check my financial aid disbursement, but the navigation options can be confusing and difficult to use.

I need to check how line breaks in reviews work. This is a test of line breaks. Results still pending.
